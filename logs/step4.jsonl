Since their\ncomposition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems\nhave traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to\nmake them their own.\nReaders of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process\nof “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings\nin language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,\nnew. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a\nmile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.\nThese expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource\nfor study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic\ntexts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The\nFolger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a\ntrusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.\nThe New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis\nfor the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their\norigin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the\nsingle greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An\nunparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and\nartwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been\nconsulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions\nalso reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of\nShakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.\nI want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul\nWerstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s\nworks, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a\nrichness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers\nwho want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow\nthe paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the\nFolger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and\ndigital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I\ncommend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.\nMichael Witmore\nDirector, Folger Shakespeare Library\nTextual Introduction\nBy Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine\nUntil now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly\nFolger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of\nShakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the\nMoby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of\nthe plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that\nthere is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But\nShakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or\nplays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some\ncases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published\nversions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great\ncollection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First\nFolio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of\nHamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.\nEditors choose which version to use as their base text, and then\namend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other\nversions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate\ntext.\nOther editorial decisions involve choices about whether an\nunfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the\nperiod or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that\nmade it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred\nyears of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on\ncultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,\nfor example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda\nto chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The\nTempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not\ntake,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare\neditors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her\nfather, Prospero.\nThe editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long\nbefore scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to\nmake the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The\nFolger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger\nShakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly\ntransparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,\nwhich hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger\nShakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial\ninterventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from\nOthello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square\nbrackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and\nfire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from\nHamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At\nany point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for\nmore information.\nBecause the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with\ntwenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger\nhere provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,\nand students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the\nplays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study\nand enjoyment of Shakespeare.\nSynopsis\nCaesar’s assassination is just the halfway point of Julius Caesar. The\nfirst part of the play leads to his death; the second portrays the\nconsequences. As the action begins, Rome prepares for Caesar’s\ntriumphal entrance. Brutus, Caesar’s friend and ally, fears that\nCaesar will become king, destroying the republic. Cassius and others\nconvince Brutus to join a conspiracy to kill Caesar.\nOn the day of the assassination, Caesar plans to stay home at the\nurging of his wife, Calphurnia. A conspirator, Decius Brutus,\npersuades him to go to the Senate with the other conspirators and his\nfriend, Mark Antony. At the Senate, the conspirators stab Caesar to\ndeath. Antony uses a funeral oration to turn the citizens of Rome\nagainst them. Brutus and Cassius escape as Antony joins forces with\nOctavius Caesar.\nEncamped with their armies, Brutus and Cassius quarrel, then agree\nto march on Antony and Octavius. In the battle which follows,\nCassius, misled by erroneous reports of loss, persuades a slave to kill\nhim; Brutus’s army is defeated. Brutus commits suicide, praised by\nAntony as “the noblest Roman of them all.”\nCharacters in the Play", "start_page": 2, "end_page": 7, "block_type": "stage_direction"}
