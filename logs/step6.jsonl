Since their\ncomposition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems\nhave traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to\nmake them their own.\nReaders of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process\nof “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings\nin language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,\nnew. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a\nmile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.\nThese expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource\nfor study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic\ntexts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The\nFolger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a\ntrusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.\nThe New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis\nfor the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their\norigin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the\nsingle greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An\nunparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and\nartwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been\nconsulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions\nalso reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of\nShakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.\nI want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul\nWerstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s\nworks, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a\nrichness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers\nwho want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow\nthe paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the\nFolger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and\ndigital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I\ncommend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.\nMichael Witmore\nDirector, Folger Shakespeare Library\nTextual Introduction\nBy Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine\nUntil now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly\nFolger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of\nShakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the\nMoby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of\nthe plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that\nthere is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But\nShakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or\nplays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some\ncases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published\nversions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great\ncollection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First\nFolio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of\nHamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.\nEditors choose which version to use as their base text, and then\namend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other\nversions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate\ntext.\nOther editorial decisions involve choices about whether an\nunfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the\nperiod or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that\nmade it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred\nyears of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on\ncultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,\nfor example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda\nto chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The\nTempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not\ntake,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare\neditors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her\nfather, Prospero.\nThe editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long\nbefore scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to\nmake the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The\nFolger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger\nShakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly\ntransparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,\nwhich hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger\nShakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial\ninterventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from\nOthello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square\nbrackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and\nfire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from\nHamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At\nany point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for\nmore information.\nBecause the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with\ntwenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger\nhere provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,\nand students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the\nplays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study\nand enjoyment of Shakespeare.\nSynopsis\nCaesar’s assassination is just the halfway point of Julius Caesar. The\nfirst part of the play leads to his death; the second portrays the\nconsequences. As the action begins, Rome prepares for Caesar’s\ntriumphal entrance. Brutus, Caesar’s friend and ally, fears that\nCaesar will become king, destroying the republic. Cassius and others\nconvince Brutus to join a conspiracy to kill Caesar.\nOn the day of the assassination, Caesar plans to stay home at the\nurging of his wife, Calphurnia. A conspirator, Decius Brutus,\npersuades him to go to the Senate with the other conspirators and his\nfriend, Mark Antony. At the Senate, the conspirators stab Caesar to\ndeath. Antony uses a funeral oration to turn the citizens of Rome\nagainst them. Brutus and Cassius escape as Antony joins forces with\nOctavius Caesar.\nEncamped with their armies, Brutus and Cassius quarrel, then agree\nto march on Antony and Octavius. In the battle which follows,\nCassius, misled by erroneous reports of loss, persuades a slave to kill\nhim; Brutus’s army is defeated. Brutus commits suicide, praised by\nAntony as “the noblest Roman of them all.”\nCharacters in the Play\n\nCAESAR\n, his wife\n\nServant to them\n\nBRUTUS\n, his wife\n\n, their servant\n\nCASSIUS\n\npatricians who, with Brutus,\n\nBRUTUS\nconspire against Caesar\n\nLIGARIUS\n\nCIMBER\n\nsenators\n\nLENA\n\ntribunes\n\nANTONY\nrulers of Rome in Acts 4 and 5\n\nServant to Antony\nServant to Octavius\n\nofficers and soldiers in the\n\nCATO\narmies of Brutus and Cassius\n\n(nonspeaking)\n\n(nonspeaking)\n\nA Carpenter\nA Cobbler\nA Soothsayer\n\nFirst, Second, Third, and Fourth Plebeians\nthe poet\n\n, slave to Cassius, freed upon Cassius’s death\n\nFirst, Second, Third, and Fourth Soldiers in Brutus’s army\nAnother Poet\nA Messenger\nFirst and Second Soldiers in Antony’s army\nCitizens, Senators, Petitioners, Plebeians, Soldiers\n\n1\nScene 1\nEnter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners,\nincluding a Carpenter and a Cobbler, over the stage.\n\nHence!

What conquest brings he home?\nWhat tributaries follow him to Rome\nTo grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?\nYou blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless\nthings! 40\nO you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,\nKnew you not Pompey?

If I have veiled my look,\nI turn the trouble of my countenance\nMerely upon myself. Vexèd I am 45\nOf late with passions of some difference,\n Conceptions only proper to myself,\nWhich give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors.\nBut let not therefore my good friends be grieved\n(Among which number, Cassius, be you one) 50\nNor construe any further my neglect\nThan that poor Brutus, with himself at war,\nForgets the shows of love to other men.\n\nThen, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,\nBy means whereof this breast of mine hath buried 55\nThoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.\nTell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?\n\nNo, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself\nBut by reflection, by some other things.\n\n’Tis just. 60\nAnd it is very much lamented, Brutus,\nThat you have no such mirrors as will turn\nYour hidden worthiness into your eye,\nThat you might see your shadow. I have heard\nWhere many of the best respect in Rome, 65\nExcept immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus\nAnd groaning underneath this age’s yoke,\nHave wished that noble Brutus had his eyes.\n\nInto what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,\nThat you would have me seek into myself 70\nFor that which is not in me?\n\nTherefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear.\nAnd since you know you cannot see yourself\nSo well as by reflection, I, your glass,\nWill modestly discover to yourself 75\nThat of yourself which you yet know not of.\nAnd be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus.\nWere I a common laughter, or did use\nTo stale with ordinary oaths my love\nTo every new protester; if you know 80\nThat I do fawn on men and hug them hard\nAnd after scandal them, or if you know\nThat I profess myself in banqueting\nTo all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\n Flourish and shout.\n\nWhat means this shouting? I do fear the people 85\nChoose Caesar for their king.\n\nAy, do you fear it?\nThen must I think you would not have it so.\n\nI would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.\nBut wherefore do you hold me here so long? 90\nWhat is it that you would impart to me?\nIf it be aught toward the general good,\nSet honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other\nAnd I will look on both indifferently;\nFor let the gods so speed me as I love 95\nThe name of honor more than I fear death.\n\nI know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,\nAs well as I do know your outward favor.\nWell, honor is the subject of my story.\nI cannot tell what you and other men 100\nThink of this life; but, for my single self,\nI had as lief not be as live to be\nIn awe of such a thing as I myself.\nI was born free as Caesar; so were you;\nWe both have fed as well, and we can both 105\nEndure the winter’s cold as well as he.\nFor once, upon a raw and gusty day,\nThe troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,\nCaesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now\nLeap in with me into this angry flood 110\nAnd swim to yonder point?” Upon the word,\nAccoutered as I was, I plungèd in\nAnd bade him follow; so indeed he did.\nThe torrent roared, and we did buffet it\nWith lusty sinews, throwing it aside 115\nAnd stemming it with hearts of controversy.\nBut ere we could arrive the point proposed,\nCaesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!”\nI, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,\nDid from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder 120\nThe old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\nDid I the tired Caesar. And this man\nIs now become a god, and Cassius is\nA wretched creature and must bend his body\nIf Caesar carelessly but nod on him. 125\nHe had a fever when he was in Spain,\nAnd when the fit was on him, I did mark\nHow he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake.\nHis coward lips did from their color fly,\nAnd that same eye whose bend doth awe the world 130\nDid lose his luster. I did hear him groan.\nAy, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans\nMark him and write his speeches in their books,\n“Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius”\nAs a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me 135\nA man of such a feeble temper should\nSo get the start of the majestic world\n And bear the palm alone.\n Shout. Flourish.\n\nAnother general shout!\n I do believe that these applauses are 140\nFor some new honors that are heaped on Caesar.\n\nWhy, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\nLike a Colossus, and we petty men\nWalk under his huge legs and peep about\nTo find ourselves dishonorable graves. 145\nMen at some time are masters of their fates.\nThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\nBut in ourselves, that we are underlings.\n“Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that\n“Caesar”? 150\nWhy should that name be sounded more than\n yours?\nWrite them together, yours is as fair a name;\nSound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\nWeigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, 155\n“Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.”\nNow, in the names of all the gods at once,\nUpon what meat doth this our Caesar feed\nThat he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!\nRome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! 160\nWhen went there by an age, since the great flood,\nBut it was famed with more than with one man?\nWhen could they say, till now, that talked of Rome,\nThat her wide walks encompassed but one man?\nNow is it Rome indeed, and room enough 165\nWhen there is in it but one only man.\nO, you and I have heard our fathers say\nThere was a Brutus once that would have brooked\nTh’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\nAs easily as a king. 170\n\nThat you do love me, I am nothing jealous.\nWhat you would work me to, I have some aim.\nHow I have thought of this, and of these times,\nI shall recount hereafter. For this present,\nI would not, so with love I might entreat you, 175\nBe any further moved. What you have said\nI will consider; what you have to say\nI will with patience hear, and find a time\nBoth meet to hear and answer such high things.\nTill then, my noble friend, chew upon this: 180\nBrutus had rather be a villager\nThan to repute himself a son of Rome\nUnder these hard conditions as this time\nIs like to lay upon us.\n\nI am glad that my weak words 185\nHave struck but thus much show of fire from\nBrutus.\n Enter Caesar and his train.\n\nThe games are done, and Caesar is returning.\n\nAs they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,\nAnd he will, after his sour fashion, tell you 190\nWhat hath proceeded worthy note today.\n\nI will do so. But look you, Cassius,\nThe angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow,\nAnd all the rest look like a chidden train.\nCalphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero 195\nLooks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\nAs we have seen him in the Capitol,\nBeing crossed in conference by some senators.\n\nCasca will tell us what the matter is.\n\nAntonius. 200\n\nCaesar.\n\nLet me have men about me that are fat,\nSleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights.\nYond Cassius has a lean and hungry look.\nHe thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. 205\n\nFear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous.\nHe is a noble Roman, and well given.\n\nWould he were fatter! But I fear him not.\nYet if my name were liable to fear,\nI do not know the man I should avoid 210\nSo soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\nHe is a great observer, and he looks\nQuite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,\nAs thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;\nSeldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort 215\nAs if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit\nThat could be moved to smile at anything.\nSuch men as he be never at heart’s ease\nWhiles they behold a greater than themselves,\nAnd therefore are they very dangerous. 220\nI rather tell thee what is to be feared\nThan what I fear; for always I am Caesar.\nCome on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\nAnd tell me truly what thou think’st of him.\nSennet. Caesar and his train exit\nbut Casca remains behind.\n\nYou pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak 225\nwith me?\n\nAy, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today\n\nThat Caesar looks so sad.\n\nWhy, you were with him, were you not?\n\nI should not then ask Casca what had chanced. 230\n\nWhy, there was a crown offered him; and, being\noffered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,\nthus, and then the people fell a-shouting.\n\nWhat was the second noise for?\n\nWhy, for that too. 235\n\nThey shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?\n\nWhy, for that too.\n\nWas the crown offered him thrice?\n\nAy, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every\n time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, 240\nmine honest neighbors shouted.\n\nWho offered him the crown?\n\nWhy, Antony.\n\nTell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\n\nI can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. 245\nIt was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark\nAntony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown\nneither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told\nyou, he put it by once; but for all that, to my\nthinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered 250\nit to him again; then he put it by again; but to my\nthinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.\nAnd then he offered it the third time. He put it the\nthird time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement\nhooted and clapped their chopped hands and 255\nthrew up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a\ndeal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the\ncrown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he\nswooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part,\nI durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and 260\nreceiving the bad air.\n\nBut soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?\n\nHe fell down in the marketplace and foamed at\nmouth and was speechless.\n\n’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. 265\n\nNo, Caesar hath it not; but you and I\nAnd honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.\n\nI know not what you mean by that, but I am\nsure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not\nclap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and 270\ndispleased them, as they use to do the players in the\ntheater, I am no true man.\n\nWhat said he when he came unto himself?\n\nMarry, before he fell down, when he perceived\n the common herd was glad he refused the crown, 275\nhe plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his\nthroat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation,\nif I would not have taken him at a word, I\nwould I might go to hell among the rogues. And so\nhe fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he 280\nhad done or said anything amiss, he desired their\nWorships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four\nwenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and\nforgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no\nheed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed 285\ntheir mothers, they would have done no less.\n\nAnd, after that, he came thus sad away?\n\nAy.\n\nDid Cicero say anything?\n\nAy, he spoke Greek. 290\n\nTo what effect?\n\nNay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’\nface again. But those that understood him smiled at\none another and shook their heads. But for mine\nown part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more 295\nnews too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves\noff Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you\nwell. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember\n it.\n\nWill you sup with me tonight, Casca? 300\n\nNo, I am promised forth.\n\nWill you dine with me tomorrow?\n\nAy, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your\ndinner worth the eating.\n\nGood. I will expect you. 305\n\nDo so. Farewell both. He exits.\n\nWhat a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\nHe was quick mettle when he went to school.\n\nSo is he now in execution\nOf any bold or noble enterprise, 310\nHowever he puts on this tardy form.\nThis rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\nWhich gives men stomach to digest his words\n With better appetite.\n\nAnd so it is. For this time I will leave you. 315\nTomorrow, if you please to speak with me,\nI will come home to you; or, if you will,\nCome home to me, and I will wait for you.\n\nI will do so. Till then, think of the world.\nBrutus exits.\n Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see 320\nThy honorable mettle may be wrought\nFrom that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet\nThat noble minds keep ever with their likes;\nFor who so firm that cannot be seduced?\nCaesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. 325\nIf I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius,\nHe should not humor me. I will this night\nIn several hands in at his windows throw,\nAs if they came from several citizens,\nWritings, all tending to the great opinion 330\nThat Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely\nCaesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at\nAnd after this, let Caesar seat him sure,\nFor we will shake him, or worse days endure.\nHe exits.\nScene 3\nThunder and lightning.

Cassius, what night is this! 45\n\nA very pleasing night to honest men.\n\nWho ever knew the heavens menace so?\n\nThose that have known the Earth so full of faults.\nFor my part, I have walked about the streets,\nSubmitting me unto the perilous night, 50\nAnd thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see,\nHave bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;\nAnd when the cross blue lightning seemed to open\nThe breast of heaven, I did present myself\nEven in the aim and very flash of it. 55\n\nBut wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?\nIt is the part of men to fear and tremble\nWhen the most mighty gods by tokens send\nSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.\n\nYou are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life 60\nThat should be in a Roman you do want,\nOr else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,\nAnd put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,\nTo see the strange impatience of the heavens.\nBut if you would consider the true cause 65\nWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\nWhy birds and beasts from quality and kind,\nWhy old men, fools, and children calculate,\nWhy all these things change from their ordinance,\nTheir natures, and preformèd faculties, 70\nTo monstrous quality—why, you shall find\nThat heaven hath infused them with these spirits\nTo make them instruments of fear and warning\n Unto some monstrous state.\nNow could I, Casca, name to thee a man 75\nMost like this dreadful night,\nThat thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars\nAs doth the lion in the Capitol;\nA man no mightier than thyself or me\nIn personal action, yet prodigious grown, 80\nAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\n\n’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?\n\nLet it be who it is. For Romans now\nHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors.\nBut, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead, 85\nAnd we are governed with our mothers’ spirits.\nOur yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\n\nIndeed, they say the Senators tomorrow\nMean to establish Caesar as a king,\nAnd he shall wear his crown by sea and land 90\nIn every place save here in Italy.\n\nI know where I will wear this dagger then;\nCassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.\nTherein, you gods, you make the weak most strong;\nTherein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat. 95\nNor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\nNor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,\nCan be retentive to the strength of spirit;\nBut life, being weary of these worldly bars,\nNever lacks power to dismiss itself. 100\nIf I know this, know all the world besides,\nThat part of tyranny that I do bear\nI can shake off at pleasure. Thunder still.\n\nSo can I.\n So every bondman in his own hand bears 105\nThe power to cancel his captivity.\n\nAnd why should Caesar be a tyrant, then?\nPoor man, I know he would not be a wolf\nBut that he sees the Romans are but sheep;\nHe were no lion, were not Romans hinds. 110\nThose that with haste will make a mighty fire\nBegin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,\nWhat rubbish, and what offal when it serves\nFor the base matter to illuminate\nSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief, 115\nWhere hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this\nBefore a willing bondman; then, I know\nMy answer must be made. But I am armed,\nAnd dangers are to me indifferent.\n\nYou speak to Casca, and to such a man 120\nThat is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand.\nThey shake hands.\nBe factious for redress of all these griefs,\nAnd I will set this foot of mine as far\n As who goes farthest.\n\nThere’s a bargain made. 125\nNow know you, Casca, I have moved already\nSome certain of the noblest-minded Romans\nTo undergo with me an enterprise\n Of honorable-dangerous consequence.\nAnd I do know by this they stay for me 130\nIn Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night,\nThere is no stir or walking in the streets;\nAnd the complexion of the element\nIn favor ’s like the work we have in hand,\n Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible. 135\nEnter Cinna.\n\nStand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\n\n’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait.\nHe is a friend.—Cinna, where haste you so?\n\nTo find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?\n\nNo, it is Casca, one incorporate 140\nTo our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna?\n\nI am glad on ’t. What a fearful night is this!\nThere’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.\n\nAm I not stayed for? Tell me.\n\nYes, you are. O Cassius, if you could 145\nBut win the noble Brutus to our party—\nCASSIUS, handing him papers\nBe you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,\nAnd look you lay it in the Praetor’s chair,\nWhere Brutus may but find it; and throw this\nIn at his window; set this up with wax 150\nUpon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,\nRepair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.\nIs Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\n\nAll but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone\nTo seek you at your house. Well, I will hie 155\nAnd so bestow these papers as you bade me.\n\nThat done, repair to Pompey’s Theater.\nCinna exits.\nCome, Casca, you and I will yet ere day\nSee Brutus at his house. Three parts of him\nIs ours already, and the man entire 160\nUpon the next encounter yields him ours.\n\nO, he sits high in all the people’s hearts,\nAnd that which would appear offense in us\n His countenance, like richest alchemy,\nWill change to virtue and to worthiness. 165\n\nHim and his worth and our great need of him\nYou have right well conceited. Let us go,\nFor it is after midnight, and ere day\nWe will awake him and be sure of him.\n They exit.", "word_count": 1339, "speakers": ["CASCA", "CASSIUS", "CICERO", "CINNA"]}

Awake, I say! What, Lucius! 5\nEnter Lucius.\n\nCalled you, my lord?\n\nGet me a taper in my study, Lucius.\nWhen it is lighted, come and call me here.\n\nI will, my lord. He exits.\n\nIt must be by his death. And for my part 10\nI know no personal cause to spurn at him,\nBut for the general. He would be crowned:\nHow that might change his nature, there’s the\n question.\nIt is the bright day that brings forth the adder, 15\nAnd that craves wary walking. Crown him that,\nAnd then I grant we put a sting in him\nThat at his will he may do danger with.\nTh’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins\nRemorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar, 20\nI have not known when his affections swayed\nMore than his reason. But ’tis a common proof\nThat lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,\nWhereto the climber-upward turns his face;\n But, when he once attains the upmost round, 25\nHe then unto the ladder turns his back,\nLooks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\nBy which he did ascend. So Caesar may.\nThen, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel\nWill bear no color for the thing he is, 30\nFashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,\nWould run to these and these extremities.\nAnd therefore think him as a serpent’s egg,\nWhich, hatched, would, as his kind, grow\nmischievous, 35\nAnd kill him in the shell.\n Enter Lucius.\n\nThe taper burneth in your closet, sir.\nSearching the window for a flint, I found\nThis paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure\nIt did not lie there when I went to bed. 40\nGives him the letter.\n\nGet you to bed again. It is not day.\nIs not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?\n\nI know not, sir.\n\nLook in the calendar, and bring me word.\n\nI will, sir. He exits. 45\n\nThe exhalations, whizzing in the air,\nGive so much light that I may read by them.\nOpens the letter and reads.\nBrutus, thou sleep’st. Awake, and see thyself!\nShall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!\n“Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake.” 50\nSuch instigations have been often dropped\nWhere I have took them up.\n“Shall Rome, etc.” Thus must I piece it out:\nShall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What,\nRome? 55\nMy ancestors did from the streets of Rome\nThe Tarquin drive when he was called a king.\n“Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated\nTo speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,\nIf the redress will follow, thou receivest 60\nThy full petition at the hand of Brutus.\n Enter Lucius.\n\nSir, March is wasted fifteen days.\nKnock within.\n\n’Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.\nLucius exits.\nSince Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,\nI have not slept. 65\nBetween the acting of a dreadful thing\nAnd the first motion, all the interim is\nLike a phantasma or a hideous dream.\nThe genius and the mortal instruments\nAre then in council, and the state of man, 70\nLike to a little kingdom, suffers then\n The nature of an insurrection.\n Enter Lucius.\n\nSir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,\nWho doth desire to see you.\n\nIs he alone? 75\n\nNo, sir. There are more with him.\n\nDo you know\nthem?\n\nNo, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears,\nAnd half their faces buried in their cloaks, 80\nThat by no means I may discover them\n By any mark of favor.\n\nLet ’em enter. Lucius exits.\nThey are the faction. O conspiracy,\nSham’st thou to show thy dang’rous brow by night, 85\nWhen evils are most free? O, then, by day\nWhere wilt thou find a cavern dark enough\nTo mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none,\n conspiracy.\nHide it in smiles and affability; 90\nFor if thou path, thy native semblance on,\nNot Erebus itself were dim enough\n To hide thee from prevention.\nEnter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,\nMetellus, and Trebonius.\n\nI think we are too bold upon your rest.\nGood morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you? 95\n\nI have been up this hour, awake all night.\nKnow I these men that come along with you?\n\nYes, every man of them; and no man here\nBut honors you, and every one doth wish\nYou had but that opinion of yourself 100\nWhich every noble Roman bears of you.\n This is Trebonius.\n\nHe is welcome hither.\n\nThis, Decius Brutus.\n\nHe is welcome too. 105\n\nThis, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.\n\nThey are all welcome.\nWhat watchful cares do interpose themselves\nBetwixt your eyes and night?\n\nShall I entreat a word? 110\nBrutus and Cassius whisper.\n\nHere lies the east; doth not the day break here?\n\nNo.\n\nO pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines\nThat fret the clouds are messengers of day.\n\nYou shall confess that you are both deceived. 115\nHere, as I point my sword, the sun arises,\nWhich is a great way growing on the south,\nWeighing the youthful season of the year.\nSome two months hence, up higher toward the\nnorth 120\nHe first presents his fire, and the high east\nStands, as the Capitol, directly here.\nBRUTUS, coming forward with Cassius\nGive me your hands all over, one by one.\n\nAnd let us swear our resolution.\n\nNo, not an oath. If not the face of men, 125\nThe sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse—\nIf these be motives weak, break off betimes,\nAnd every man hence to his idle bed.\nSo let high-sighted tyranny range on\nTill each man drop by lottery. But if these— 130\nAs I am sure they do—bear fire enough\nTo kindle cowards and to steel with valor\nThe melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,\nWhat need we any spur but our own cause\nTo prick us to redress? What other bond 135\nThan secret Romans that have spoke the word\nAnd will not palter? And what other oath\n Than honesty to honesty engaged\nThat this shall be or we will fall for it?\nSwear priests and cowards and men cautelous, 140\nOld feeble carrions, and such suffering souls\nThat welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear\nSuch creatures as men doubt; but do not stain\nThe even virtue of our enterprise,\nNor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits, 145\nTo think that or our cause or our performance\nDid need an oath, when every drop of blood\nThat every Roman bears, and nobly bears,\nIs guilty of a several bastardy\nIf he do break the smallest particle 150\nOf any promise that hath passed from him.\n\nBut what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?\nI think he will stand very strong with us.\n\nLet us not leave him out.\n\nNo, by no means. 155\n\nO, let us have him, for his silver hairs\nWill purchase us a good opinion\nAnd buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.\nIt shall be said his judgment ruled our hands.\nOur youths and wildness shall no whit appear, 160\nBut all be buried in his gravity.\n\nO, name him not! Let us not break with him,\nFor he will never follow anything\n That other men begin.\n\nThen leave him out. 165\n\nIndeed, he is not fit.\n\nShall no man else be touched, but only Caesar?\n\nDecius, well urged. I think it is not meet\nMark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,\nShould outlive Caesar. We shall find of him 170\nA shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,\nIf he improve them, may well stretch so far\nAs to annoy us all; which to prevent,\nLet Antony and Caesar fall together.\n\nOur course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, 175\nTo cut the head off and then hack the limbs,\nLike wrath in death and envy afterwards;\nFor Antony is but a limb of Caesar.\nLet’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.\nWe all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, 180\nAnd in the spirit of men there is no blood.\nO, that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit\nAnd not dismember Caesar! But, alas,\nCaesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,\nLet’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully. 185\nLet’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,\nNot hew him as a carcass fit for hounds.\nAnd let our hearts, as subtle masters do,\nStir up their servants to an act of rage\nAnd after seem to chide ’em. This shall make 190\nOur purpose necessary and not envious;\nWhich so appearing to the common eyes,\nWe shall be called purgers, not murderers.\nAnd for Mark Antony, think not of him,\nFor he can do no more than Caesar’s arm 195\nWhen Caesar’s head is off.\n\nYet I fear him,\nFor in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar—\n\nAlas, good Cassius, do not think of him.\nIf he love Caesar, all that he can do 200\nIs to himself: take thought and die for Caesar.\nAnd that were much he should, for he is given\nTo sports, to wildness, and much company.\n\nThere is no fear in him. Let him not die,\nFor he will live and laugh at this hereafter. 205\nClock strikes.\n\nPeace, count the clock.\n\nThe clock hath stricken\nthree.\n\n’Tis time to part.\n\nBut it is doubtful yet 210\nWhether Caesar will come forth today or no,\nFor he is superstitious grown of late,\nQuite from the main opinion he held once\nOf fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.\nIt may be these apparent prodigies, 215\nThe unaccustomed terror of this night,\nAnd the persuasion of his augurers\nMay hold him from the Capitol today.\n\nNever fear that. If he be so resolved,\nI can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear 220\nThat unicorns may be betrayed with trees,\nAnd bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\nLions with toils, and men with flatterers.\nBut when I tell him he hates flatterers,\nHe says he does, being then most flatterèd. 225\nLet me work,\nFor I can give his humor the true bent,\nAnd I will bring him to the Capitol.\n\nNay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.\n\nBy the eighth hour, is that the uttermost? 230\n\nBe that the uttermost, and fail not then.\n\nCaius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,\nWho rated him for speaking well of Pompey.\nI wonder none of you have thought of him.\n\nNow, good Metellus, go along by him. 235\nHe loves me well, and I have given him reasons.\nSend him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.\n\nThe morning comes upon ’s. We’ll leave you,\n\nBrutus.\n\nAnd, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember 240\nWhat you have said, and show yourselves true\n Romans.\n\nGood gentlemen, look fresh and merrily.\nLet not our looks put on our purposes,\nBut bear it, as our Roman actors do, 245\nWith untired spirits and formal constancy.\nAnd so good morrow to you every one.\nAll but Brutus exit.\nBoy! Lucius!—Fast asleep? It is no matter.\nEnjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.\nThou hast no figures nor no fantasies 250\nWhich busy care draws in the brains of men.\n Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.\n Enter Portia.\n\nBrutus, my lord.\n\nPortia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?\nIt is not for your health thus to commit 255\nYour weak condition to the raw cold morning.\n\nNor for yours neither. You’ve ungently, Brutus,\nStole from my bed. And yesternight at supper\nYou suddenly arose and walked about,\nMusing and sighing, with your arms across, 260\nAnd when I asked you what the matter was,\nYou stared upon me with ungentle looks.\nI urged you further; then you scratched your head\nAnd too impatiently stamped with your foot.\nYet I insisted; yet you answered not, 265\nBut with an angry wafture of your hand\nGave sign for me to leave you. So I did,\n Fearing to strengthen that impatience\nWhich seemed too much enkindled, and withal\nHoping it was but an effect of humor, 270\nWhich sometime hath his hour with every man.\nIt will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep,\nAnd could it work so much upon your shape\nAs it hath much prevailed on your condition,\nI should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord, 275\nMake me acquainted with your cause of grief.\n\nI am not well in health, and that is all.\n\nBrutus is wise and, were he not in health,\nHe would embrace the means to come by it.\n\nWhy so I do. Good Portia, go to bed. 280\n\nIs Brutus sick? And is it physical\nTo walk unbracèd and suck up the humors\nOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\nAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed\nTo dare the vile contagion of the night 285\nAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air\nTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,\nYou have some sick offense within your mind,\nWhich by the right and virtue of my place\nI ought to know of. She kneels. And upon my 290\nknees\nI charm you, by my once commended beauty,\nBy all your vows of love, and that great vow\nWhich did incorporate and make us one,\nThat you unfold to me, your self, your half, 295\nWhy you are heavy, and what men tonight\nHave had resort to you; for here have been\nSome six or seven who did hide their faces\n Even from darkness.\n\nKneel not, gentle Portia. 300\nHe lifts her up.\n\nI should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.\nWithin the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,\nIs it excepted I should know no secrets\nThat appertain to you? Am I your self\nBut, as it were, in sort or limitation, 305\nTo keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\nAnd talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the\n suburbs\nOf your good pleasure? If it be no more,\nPortia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife. 310\n\nYou are my true and honorable wife,\nAs dear to me as are the ruddy drops\n That visit my sad heart.\n\nIf this were true, then should I know this secret.\nI grant I am a woman, but withal 315\nA woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.\nI grant I am a woman, but withal\n A woman well-reputed, Cato’s daughter.\nThink you I am no stronger than my sex,\nBeing so fathered and so husbanded? 320\nTell me your counsels; I will not disclose ’em.\nI have made strong proof of my constancy,\n Giving myself a voluntary wound\nHere, in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience,\nAnd not my husband’s secrets? 325\n\nO you gods,\nRender me worthy of this noble wife! Knock.\nHark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,\nAnd by and by thy bosom shall partake\nThe secrets of my heart. 330\nAll my engagements I will construe to thee,\nAll the charactery of my sad brows.\nLeave me with haste. Portia exits.\n Lucius, who ’s that knocks?\n Enter Lucius and Ligarius.\n\nHere is a sick man that would speak with you. 335\n\nCaius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.—\nBoy, stand aside. Lucius exits.\nCaius Ligarius, how?\n\nVouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.\n\nO, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, 340\nTo wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!\n\nI am not sick, if Brutus have in hand\nAny exploit worthy the name of honor.\n\nSuch an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,\nHad you a healthful ear to hear of it. 345\n\nBy all the gods that Romans bow before,\n\nI here discard my sickness.\n\nHe takes off his kerchief.\nSoul of Rome,\n\nBrave son derived from honorable loins,\n\nThou like an exorcist hast conjured up 350\nMy mortifièd spirit. Now bid me run,\n\nAnd I will strive with things impossible,\n\nYea, get the better of them. What’s to do?\n\nA piece of work that will make sick men whole.\n\nBut are not some whole that we must make sick? 355\n\nThat must we also. What it is, my Caius,\nI shall unfold to thee as we are going\nTo whom it must be done.\n\nSet on your foot,\n And with a heart new-fired I follow you 360\nTo do I know not what; but it sufficeth\nThat Brutus leads me on.

I rather choose\nTo wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\nThan I will wrong such honorable men.\nBut here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. 140\nI found it in his closet. ’Tis his will.\nLet but the commons hear this testament,\nWhich, pardon me, I do not mean to read,\nAnd they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds\nAnd dip their napkins in his sacred blood— 145\nYea, beg a hair of him for memory\nAnd, dying, mention it within their wills,\nBequeathing it as a rich legacy\n Unto their issue.\n\nPLEBEIAN\n We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. 150\n\nThe will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will.\n\nHave patience, gentle friends. I must not read it.\nIt is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\nYou are not wood, you are not stones, but men.\nAnd, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, 155\nIt will inflame you; it will make you mad.\n’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,\nFor if you should, O, what would come of it?\n\nPLEBEIAN\nRead the will! We’ll hear it, Antony.\n\nYou shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. 160\n\nWill you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\nI have o’ershot myself to tell you of it.\nI fear I wrong the honorable men\nWhose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.\n\nPLEBEIAN They were traitors. Honorable men? 165\n\nThe will! The testament!\n\nPLEBEIAN They were villains, murderers. The\nwill! Read the will.\n\nYou will compel me, then, to read the will?\nThen make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, 170\nAnd let me show you him that made the will.\nShall I descend? And will you give me leave?\n\nCome down.\n\nPLEBEIAN Descend.\n\nPLEBEIAN You shall have leave. 175\nAntony descends.\n\nPLEBEIAN A ring; stand round.\n\nPLEBEIAN\nStand from the hearse. Stand from the body.\n\nPLEBEIAN\nRoom for Antony, most noble Antony.\n\nNay, press not so upon me. Stand far off.\n\nStand back! Room! Bear back! 180\n\nIf you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\nYou all do know this mantle. I remember\nThe first time ever Caesar put it on.\n’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent,\nThat day he overcame the Nervii. 185\nLook, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through.\nSee what a rent the envious Casca made.\nThrough this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed,\nAnd, as he plucked his cursèd steel away,\nMark how the blood of Caesar followed it, 190\nAs rushing out of doors to be resolved\nIf Brutus so unkindly knocked or no;\nFor Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel.\nJudge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!\nThis was the most unkindest cut of all. 195\nFor when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\nIngratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,\nQuite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart,\nAnd, in his mantle muffling up his face,\nEven at the base of Pompey’s statue 200\n(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell.\nO, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\nThen I and you and all of us fell down,\nWhilst bloody treason flourished over us.\nO, now you weep, and I perceive you feel 205\nThe dint of pity. These are gracious drops.\nKind souls, what, weep you when you but behold\nOur Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here,\nAntony lifts Caesar’s cloak.\nHere is himself, marred as you see with traitors.\n\nPLEBEIAN O piteous spectacle! 210\n\nPLEBEIAN O noble Caesar!\n\nPLEBEIAN O woeful day!\n\nPLEBEIAN O traitors, villains!\n\nPLEBEIAN O most bloody sight!\n\nPLEBEIAN We will be revenged. 215\nRevenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!\n\nSlay! Let not a traitor live!\n\nStay, countrymen.\n\nPLEBEIAN Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.\n\nPLEBEIAN We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, 220\nwe’ll die with him.\n\nGood friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\nTo such a sudden flood of mutiny.\nThey that have done this deed are honorable.\nWhat private griefs they have, alas, I know not, 225\nThat made them do it. They are wise and honorable\nAnd will no doubt with reasons answer you.\nI come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.\nI am no orator, as Brutus is,\nBut, as you know me all, a plain blunt man 230\nThat love my friend, and that they know full well\nThat gave me public leave to speak of him.\nFor I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\nAction, nor utterance, nor the power of speech\nTo stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. 235\nI tell you that which you yourselves do know,\nShow you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb\n mouths,\nAnd bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,\nAnd Brutus Antony, there were an Antony 240\nWould ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue\nIn every wound of Caesar that should move\nThe stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\n\nWe’ll mutiny.\n\nPLEBEIAN We’ll burn the house of Brutus. 245\n\nPLEBEIAN\nAway then. Come, seek the conspirators.\n\nYet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.\n\nPeace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!\n\nWhy, friends, you go to do you know not what.\nWherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? 250\nAlas, you know not. I must tell you then.\nYou have forgot the will I told you of.\n\nMost true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will.\n\nHere is the will, and under Caesar’s seal:\nTo every Roman citizen he gives, 255\nTo every several man, seventy-five drachmas.\n\nPLEBEIAN\nMost noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death.\n\nPLEBEIAN O royal Caesar!\n\nHear me with patience.\n\nPeace, ho! 260\n\nMoreover, he hath left you all his walks,\nHis private arbors, and new-planted orchards,\nOn this side Tiber. He hath left them you,\nAnd to your heirs forever—common pleasures\nTo walk abroad and recreate yourselves. 265\nHere was a Caesar! When comes such another?\n\nPLEBEIAN\nNever, never!—Come, away, away!\nWe’ll burn his body in the holy place\nAnd with the brands fire the traitors’ houses.\n Take up the body. 270\n\nPLEBEIAN Go fetch fire.\n\nPLEBEIAN Pluck down benches.", "word_count": 2278, "speakers": ["ANTONY", "BRUTUS", "FIRST", "FOURTH", "PLEBEIANS", "SECOND", "SERVANT", "THIRD"]}

Since their\ncomposition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems\nhave traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to\nmake them their own.\nReaders of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process\nof “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings\nin language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,\nnew. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a\nmile a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds.\nThese expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource\nfor study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic\ntexts of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as The\nFolger Shakespeare (formerly Folger Digital Texts), we place a\ntrusted resource in the hands of anyone who wants them.\nThe New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis\nfor the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their\norigin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the\nsingle greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An\nunparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and\nartwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been\nconsulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions\nalso reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of\nShakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theatre.\nI want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul\nWerstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s\nworks, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a\nrichness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers\nwho want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow\nthe paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the\nFolger either in-person or online, where a range of physical and\ndigital resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I\ncommend to you these words, and hope that they inspire.\nMichael Witmore\nDirector, Folger Shakespeare Library\nTextual Introduction\nBy Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine\nUntil now, with the release of The Folger Shakespeare (formerly\nFolger Digital Texts), readers in search of a free online text of\nShakespeare’s plays had to be content primarily with using the\nMoby™ Text, which reproduces a late-nineteenth century version of\nthe plays. What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that\nthere is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But\nShakespeare’s plays were not published the way modern novels or\nplays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some\ncases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published\nversions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great\ncollection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First\nFolio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of\nHamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others.\nEditors choose which version to use as their base text, and then\namend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other\nversions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate\ntext.\nOther editorial decisions involve choices about whether an\nunfamiliar word could be understood in light of other writings of the\nperiod or whether it should be changed; decisions about words that\nmade it into Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred\nyears of printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on\ncultural preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created,\nfor example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda\nto chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The\nTempest, 1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not\ntake,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare\neditors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her\nfather, Prospero.\nThe editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long\nbefore scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to\nmake the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The\nFolger Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger\nShakespeare texts depend, make this editorial process as nearly\ntransparent as is possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™,\nwhich hide editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger\nShakespeare knows where the text has been altered because editorial\ninterventions are signaled by square brackets (for example, from\nOthello: “ If she in chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square\nbrackets (for example, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and\nfire to win your right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from\nHamlet: “O farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At\nany point in the text, you can hover your cursor over a bracket for\nmore information.\nBecause the Folger Shakespeare texts are edited in accord with\ntwenty-first century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger\nhere provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors,\nand students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the\nplays and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study\nand enjoyment of Shakespeare.\nSynopsis\nCaesar’s assassination is just the halfway point of Julius Caesar. The\nfirst part of the play leads to his death; the second portrays the\nconsequences. As the action begins, Rome prepares for Caesar’s\ntriumphal entrance. Brutus, Caesar’s friend and ally, fears that\nCaesar will become king, destroying the republic. Cassius and others\nconvince Brutus to join a conspiracy to kill Caesar.\nOn the day of the assassination, Caesar plans to stay home at the\nurging of his wife, Calphurnia. A conspirator, Decius Brutus,\npersuades him to go to the Senate with the other conspirators and his\nfriend, Mark Antony. At the Senate, the conspirators stab Caesar to\ndeath. Antony uses a funeral oration to turn the citizens of Rome\nagainst them. Brutus and Cassius escape as Antony joins forces with\nOctavius Caesar.\nEncamped with their armies, Brutus and Cassius quarrel, then agree\nto march on Antony and Octavius. In the battle which follows,\nCassius, misled by erroneous reports of loss, persuades a slave to kill\nhim; Brutus’s army is defeated. Brutus commits suicide, praised by\nAntony as “the noblest Roman of them all.”\nCharacters in the Play", "start_page": 2, "end_page": 7, "word_count": 1081, "is_soliloquy": false}
